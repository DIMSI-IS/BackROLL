## What's BackROLL ?

BackROLL is modern, containerized and open-source backup solution for KVM guests.
It allows you to define logical KVM pools and backup policies to backup all your KVM guests according to your needs.

It's also

- A beautiful web UI to manage and monitor your backups, launch restore tasks, etc.
- No downtime during backups
- No agent on guests nor KVM hosts
- Fully containerized with minimum maintenance needed
