## What's BackROLL‚ÄØ?

BackROLL is modern, containerized and open-source backup solution for KVM guests.
It allows you to define logical KVM pools and backup policies to backup all your KVM guests according to your needs.

It's also

- A beautiful web UI to manage and monitor your backups, launch restore tasks, etc.
- No downtime during backups
- No agent on guests nor KVM hosts
- Fully containerized with minimum maintenance needed

## What do I need‚ÄØ?

### Requirements

- Docker and Docker Compose (minimal version 2.24)
- A Bash terminal (Ubuntu is recommended or use WSL)

### Replaceable components

Backroll has some default components that can be replaced by your own ones.

#### Recommended

- An OpenID provider (Keycloak, Google/Microsoft, Okta, etc.)

If you choose to use the default provider, please harden it with SSL certificate, secure password, etc..

#### Optional

- A MySQL/MariaDB database

## Get Started

### Docker and Docker Compose

Backroll requires Docker and Docker Compose. Please refer to the official Docker documentation to install them¬†:

- install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- install [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/linux/)

### Quickstart üöÄ

Backroll is distributed through git and structured as a Docker Compose project. We have baked quickstart script which clones the repository and runs the commands from the [dedicated compose project README](./compose_project/README.md).

Use Bash to get and run the quickstart script of the release you target. You will be guided through the setup of the components and some accounts. To use your own OpenID provider or database please prepare your credentials.

After the setup process, the containers will be starting. The default database initialization lasts approximately one minute. Then open your host address in a web browser to access the Backroll‚ÄØUI.

#### Latest prerelease or release

```bash
source <(curl -L https://github.com/DIMSI-IS/BackROLL/releases/download/v0.4.0-alpha-1/quickstart.sh)
```

#### Manage your containers

Those are the basic commands you need to know. Find more details there [dedicated compose project README](./compose_project/README.md).

Go to the compose project directory

```bash
cd compose_project
```

Set environment variables

```bash
source source-me.sh
```

Start the containers

```bash
docker compose $prod up -d
```

Stop the containers

```bash
docker compose $prod stop
```

Show containers logs

```bash
docker compose $prod logs
```

### Developers‚Äô setup

If you are developer and want to contribute to the project, see the [developers‚Äô setup](./documentation/developers_setup.md).

## Backroll configuration

### Storage configuration

To perform backup and restore tasks, Backroll's workers need an access to the VMs storage and to a backup storage. \
By default in the docker-compose.yml, /mnt/ is mapped to /mnt/ in the workers.

#### VM Storage configuration

On the backroll VM, mount the VMs storage to a path that is mapped in docker-compose.yml.
If you are mounting a Cloudstack Primary storage please respect the Cloudstack format such as: /mnt/PR_STORAGE_ID
Repeat for each VM storage.

Example using a NFS storage:

```bash
# Create directory under /mnt/
mkdir /mnt/myVM_storage

# Optional, under Ubuntu nfs-common might be required
apt install nfs-common

# Mount using NFS, to make the mount persistent, edit fstab with corresponding values
mount -v -t nfs -o nolock NFS_server:/nfs_share1 /mnt/myVM_storage

# Once your NFS share is mounted, please restart the containers
docker compose $prod stop
docker compose $prod up -d
```

Example using a Cloudstack NFS storage:

```bash
#If you are mounting a Cloudstack Primary storage please respect the Cloudstack format such as: /mnt/PR_STORAGE_ID
# Create directory under /mnt/ corresponding to your CS primary storage
mkdir /mnt/138338fb-xxxx-xxxx-b219-ff968ca3ed3d

# Mount using NFS, to make the mount persistent, edit fstab with corresponding values
mount -v -t nfs -o nolock NFS_server:/nfs_shareCS1 /mnt/138338fb-xxxx-xxxx-b219-ff968ca3ed3d

# Once your NFS share is mounted, please restart the containers
docker compose $prod stop
docker compose $prod up -d
```

#### Backup storage configuration

On the backroll VM, mount the backup storage to a path that is mapped in docker-compose.yml.\
Then in Backroll UI, Configuration > Storage > Add new storage > Input Name and the path > Validate\

Example using a NFS storage:

```bash
# Create directory under /mnt/
mkdir /mnt/backup_storage

# Mount using NFS, to make the mount persistent, edit fstab with corresponding values
mount -v -t nfs -o nolock NFS_server:/nfs_backup_share1 /mnt/backup_storage

Then add your storage in the Backroll UI.

```

## Backroll with Cloudstack

### Configure the Backroll plugin

**Cloudstack Global Settings**\
In Cloudstack's Global settings, fill the fields with the appropriate value:

- Backup framework provider plugin: _backroll_
- Backup plugin backroll config appname: _Name of your app name used for backroll api_
- Backup plugin backroll config password: _Secret for the backroll_api found in your oauth provider._
- Backup plugin backroll config url: _URL of your backroll_

**Cloudstack user**\
Backroll uses an API key and secret to communicate with Cloudstack.\
In Cloudstack, under accounts, create a user dedicated to backroll.\
Generate API Keys and Secret.

**Backroll side**\
In the backroll UI, under Configuration select Connectors.\
Add a new connector and fill the field with the appropriate information:

- Name: _Name of your connector_
- Endpoint URL: _ URL of your cloudstack instance API https://x.x.x.x.com/client/api _
- Login: _API_key of your user dedicated to backroll_
- Password: _API_secret of your user dedicated to backroll_
