## What's BackROLL ?

BackROLL is modern, containerized and open-source backup solution for KVM guests.
It allows you to define logical KVM pools and backup policies to backup all your KVM guests according to your needs.

It's also

- A beautiful web UI to manage and monitor your backups, launch restore tasks, etc.
- No downtime during backups
- No agent on guests nor KVM hosts
- Fully containerized with minimum maintenance needed

## What do I need?
BackROLL 1.1.0 requires at least
- A MySQL/MariaDB database
- A server which can run Docker
- An OpenID provider (Keycloak, Google/Microsoft, Okta, etc.)

## Get Started

TBD

## Documentation
The [latest documentation](https://backroll.readthedocs.io/) is hosted at Read The Docs, containing user guides, tutorials, and an API reference.

## Help and support
We'd love to help you get started with BackROLL, so please feel free to open a case if you run into problems with the deployment or encounter bugs.

We are also looking for volunteers interested in the project to propose improvements, bug fixes or any other help that would be beneficial to this project.
