## What's BackROLL ?

BackROLL is modern, containerized and open-source backup solution for KVM guests.
It allows you to define logical KVM pools and backup policies to backup all your KVM guests according to your needs.

It's also

- A beautiful web UI to manage and monitor your backups, launch restore tasks, etc.
- No downtime during backups
- No agent on guests nor KVM hosts
- Fully containerized with minimum maintenance needed

## Our demo made during the CloudStack European User Group (APRIL) 2022

- A Bash terminal

### Default components

Backroll has some default components that can be replaced by your own ones.

If you choose to use the default provider, please harden it with SSL certificate, secure password, etc..

#### Optional

- A MySQL/MariaDB database

## Get Started

### Docker and Docker Compose

Backroll requires Docker and Docker Compose. Please refer to the official Docker documentation to install them.

- Install Docker https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/
- Install Docker Compose https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/linux/

Take a look at the `docker compose` command reference at https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/compose/. You must know about the main commands‚ÄØ:
- docker compose start
- docker compose stop
- docker compose ps
- docker compose logs

### Compose projects

Learn more about setting up and running Backroll in the [dedicated compose projects‚Äô README](./compose_project/README.md).

## Backroll configuration

### Storage configuration

To perform backup and restore tasks, Backroll's workers need an access to the VMs storage and to a backup storage. \
By default in the docker-compose.yml, /mnt/ is mapped to /mnt/ in the workers.

#### VM Storage configuration

On the backroll VM, mount the VMs storage to a path that is mapped in docker-compose.yml.
If you are mounting a Cloudstack Primary storage please respect the Cloudstack format such as: /mnt/PR_STORAGE_ID
Repeat for each VM storage.

Example using a NFS storage:

```bash
# Create directory under /mnt/
mkdir /mnt/myVM_storage

# Mount using NFS, to make the mount persistent, edit fstab with corresponding values
mount -v -t nfs -o nolock NFS_server:/nfs_share1 /mnt/myVM_storage

```

Example using a Cloudstack NFS storage:

```bash
#If you are mounting a Cloudstack Primary storage please respect the Cloudstack format such as: /mnt/PR_STORAGE_ID
# Create directory under /mnt/ corresponding to your CS primary storage
mkdir /mnt/138338fb-xxxx-xxxx-b219-ff968ca3ed3d

# Mount using NFS, to make the mount persistent, edit fstab with corresponding values
mount -v -t nfs -o nolock NFS_server:/nfs_shareCS1 /mnt/138338fb-xxxx-xxxx-b219-ff968ca3ed3d

```

#### Backup storage configuration

On the backroll VM, mount the backup storage to a path that is mapped in docker-compose.yml.\
Then in Backroll UI, Configuration > Storage > Add new storage > Input Name and the path > Validate\

Example using a NFS storage:

```bash
# Create directory under /mnt/
mkdir /mnt/backup_storage

# Mount using NFS, to make the mount persistent, edit fstab with corresponding values
mount -v -t nfs -o nolock NFS_server:/nfs_backup_share1 /mnt/backup_storage

Then add your storage in the Backroll UI.

```

**Cloudstack user**\
Backroll uses an API key and secret to communicate with Cloudstack.\
In Cloudstack, under accounts, create a user dedicated to backroll.\
Generate API Keys and Secret.

**Backroll side**\
In the backroll UI, under Configuration select Connectors.\
Add a new connector and fill the field with the appropriate information:

- Name: _Name of your connector_
- Endpoint URL: _URL of your cloudstack instance_
- Login: _API_key of your user dedicated to backroll_
- Password: _API_secret of your user dedicated to backroll_
