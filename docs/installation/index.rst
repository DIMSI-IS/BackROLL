Installation guide
==================

Welcome to the installation guide for BackROLL.

As of today, the only **recommended operating system is Ubuntu (18.04 and further)**.

.. note::

  For more experimented users, you can easily adapt this guide for another LINUX operating system as long as your server can run Docker.
